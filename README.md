# Sales Prediction using Python

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting sales using Python-based machine learning models. By analyzing historical sales data, it aims to provide insights and improve forecasting accuracy.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains transactional data, including sales amount, product category, region, and customer demographics.
- The data is preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers before applying machine learning models.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load the dataset, clean missing values, and perform feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data trends using plots and statistical summaries.
3. **Model Selection**: Apply various regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared to evaluate performance.
5. **Prediction**: Forecast sales based on input features.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies using `pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute all cells sequentially.
3. Review model predictions and visualizations.

## Results
- The model provides accurate sales forecasts based on historical trends.
- Feature importance analysis helps in understanding key factors affecting sales.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning models for better accuracy.
- Integrate real-time data for dynamic sales forecasting.
- Develop a web-based dashboard for visualization and analysis.
